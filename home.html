      <h2>What's with your name?</h2>
      <p>
        I spent a semester playing women's rugby in college. My old/legal name
        was three syllables and I wanted something shorter that could be yelled.
        I thought Rob was cool. <i>Cue gender feelings.</i> <br /><br />
        Originally, I said Rob was short for Robert, but I was so used to being
        the only one with my name in places that having to best every single
        Rob, Bob, Bobby and Robby in hand-to-hand combat was daunting. (That's
        what you have to do when you have the same name as someone. I don't make
        the rules.) <br /><br />
        I also felt disconnected from Robert as a name and chose the non-binary
        noun name of Robot because 1) R.O.B. from Nintendo was cool and 2) Robot
        is a really cool name.

      <h2>What did you do before coding?</h2>
      <p>
        Not much, really. <br /><br />
        From childhood to my sophomore year of college, I was focused on
        classical music, mainly on viola and mainly in orchestral settings.
        Chamber music was ok, but people actually showed up to the big ensemble
        concerts. During my freshman year of college, I started taking
        engineering classes for fun.
        <br /><br />
        I switched majors to nuclear engineering, which is what my bachelor's is
        in. I worked at a nuclear plant for almost five years. In 2020, I met my
        wife online through a transgender-only Discord server. She helped me
        realize 1) I was autistic as hell, 2) I was being treated really poorly
        at my job (i.e. being placed on unpaid leave for over a month after
        requesting ADA accommodations, only to have my requests denied). I left
        my job to move across the country and live with her. <br /><br />
        Because of the treatment I faced at my old plant, I decided to leave the
        nuclear industry and make a career change to software engineering. It
        helps that my wife's a senior software engineer so I can go to her for
        help and tips. <br /><br />
